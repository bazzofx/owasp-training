Given the following HTML and JavaScript example demonstrating a security concept (e.g., Security Misconfiguration), please create similar practical examples for other common web application vulnerabilities. Each example should include:

A clear title indicating the vulnerability.

An insecure demo with interactive elements (like buttons or inputs) that show how the vulnerability can be exploited or appears.

A secure demo illustrating a proper fix or mitigation.

Minimal but clear HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to run the demo in a browser.

Use the following sample as a template:


<!-- Paste the full HTML example here -->


Focus on vulnerabilities like Broken Access Control, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), DOM-based Injection, Insecure Direct Object References, etc., while keeping the UI simple and user-friendly.

Please generate complete standalone HTML examples, suitable for education and testing purposes.
